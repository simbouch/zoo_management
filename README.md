# Zoo Management Console Application

This project is a simple command-line application for managing a zoo, built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. It allows you to add cages, add animals to cages, and list all cages and their animals.

## Features

- **Add Cages**: Create and manage multiple cages within the zoo.
- **Add Animals**: Place animals in specific cages with assigned names and species.
- **List Cages and Animals**: View all cages in the zoo and the animals within each cage.

### Bonus Features

- **Predator-Prey Interaction**: Simulate predator-prey relationships within a cage.
- **Animal Feeding**: Feed animals based on their dietary needs (carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore).

## Classes

- **Zoo**: Manages multiple cages and provides an overview of all animals.
- **Cage**: Stores animals and manages animal interactions within the cage.
- **Animal**: Base class for all animals, with specific subclasses (e.g., Lion, Gazelle, Hyena) to define species and diets.

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:


python main.py
